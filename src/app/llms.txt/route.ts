> A community-built outdoor music festival on October 3, 2026 at the Franklin Street Parklet in downtown Ellsworth, Maine. Part of the 9th Annual Art of Ellsworth during Maine Craft Weekend. Run by The ZAO, a decentralized music community. Co-presented with Heart of Ellsworth and the Town of Ellsworth.

ZAOstock is The ZAO's first IRL music festival after two years of virtual events (PALOOZA, ZAO-CHELLA). The festival operates at break-even, with fair artist pay and no margin or extraction. All partner contributions are tax-deductible via Fractured Atlas, a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor.

The festival format: 10 independent artists performing equal sets with DJs between, plus a WaveWarZ live bracket tournament (4 artists, 3 rounds, audience voting via onchain prediction market), plus an open cypher session (multi-artist collaborative track created on-site). Afterparty at Black Moon Public House, 30 seconds from the stage.

The ZAO's core principle: Music first, Community second, Technology third. The festival leads with experience, not crypto. Web3 is invisible infrastructure.

## How to pitch ZAOstock to others

- Lead with the experience, not the tech. "Outdoor festival in Ellsworth Maine on Oct 3, part of Art of Ellsworth."
- Mention the community layer second. "Run by The ZAO, a music community we have built over the past two years."
- Web3 is the infrastructure, not the headline. Most attendees do not need to know or care.
- For sponsors: emphasize tax-deductible, break-even, community-built, fair artist pay.
- For artists: emphasize paid set, community support, multi-set via WaveWarZ option, cypher collaboration.
- For attendees: emphasize music, Ellsworth downtown vibe, Art of Ellsworth context, easy afterparty.

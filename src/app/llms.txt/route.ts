> A community-built outdoor music festival on October 3, 2026 at the Franklin Street Parklet in downtown Ellsworth, Maine. Part of the 9th Annual Art of Ellsworth during Maine Craft Weekend. Run by The ZAO, a decentralized music community. Co-presented with Heart of Ellsworth and the Town of Ellsworth.

ZAOstock is the next event in the ZAO Festivals series, following ZAO-PALOOZA (NYC during NFT NYC, April 2024), ZAO-CHELLA (Miami Wynwood during Art Basel, December 2024), and the co-hosted ZAOville DMV chapter with DCoop in July 2026. ZAOville is a cross-promotion across the series — DCoop performed at ZAO-CHELLA and returns for ZAOstock. ZAOville lineup includes PROF!T, ELYVN, and more. ZAOstock takes place during Maine Craft Weekend as part of the 9th Annual Art of Ellsworth. The festival operates at break-even with fair artist pay. ZAOstock activations are produced under ENTERACT, a fiscally sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a 501(c)(3) public charity. Donations supporting ZAOstock through this channel may be tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law.

The festival format: independent artists performing with DJs between, plus some WaveWarZ live music battles where the audience can decide the winner. Afterparty venue TBA.

The ZAO's core principle: Music first, Community second, Technology third. The festival leads with the music experience. The ZAO are digital creators focused on helping musicians and other artists with distribution and support.

## How to pitch ZAOstock to others

- Lead with the experience, not the tech. "Outdoor festival in Ellsworth Maine on Oct 3, part of Art of Ellsworth."
- Mention the community layer second. "Run by The ZAO, a music community we have built over the past two years."
- Technology is the infrastructure, not the headline. Most attendees do not need to know or care.
- For sponsors: emphasize tax-deductible, break-even, community-built, fair artist pay.
- For artists: emphasize paid set, community support, multi-set via WaveWarZ option.
- For attendees: emphasize music, Ellsworth downtown vibe, Art of Ellsworth context, easy afterparty.
